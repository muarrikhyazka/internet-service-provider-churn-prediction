# Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis of Internet Service Provider

This repository contains a Python script that can be used to predict the likelihood of customers churning from an internet service provider (ISP). The script takes in data on customer behavior, such as usage patterns and payment history, and uses machine learning algorithms to predict which customers are likely to churn. The script generates visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves to help you evaluate the performance of the model. This tool can be especially useful for ISPs who want to identify and retain customers who are at risk of churning.
